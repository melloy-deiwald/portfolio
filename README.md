# Lulu's Portfolio made with React

This is a personal hobby portfolio for my projects that I make. It's also there to experiment with a bit of front end web development. It's nothing particularly serious, and it's not the best code I've ever written, though I do try to keep it somewhat clean.

My magnum opus and focus on this website is the gallery section which shows off my efforts in teaching myself photography. There's also some work with animations and stuff but not really that much in terms of programming.

I've also used it to learn a lot about sysadmin stuff required to set all of this up, as this projects runs on a Raspberry Pi. It's available under [https://melloy.myftp.org/portfolio](https://melloy.myftp.org/portfolio)
